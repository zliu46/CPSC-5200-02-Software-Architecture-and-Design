Office Hours via MS Teams or in-person.

To meet at a different time, I can often meet on Teams. Use email or Teams to schedule a mutually agreeable time.
Welcome to the Course

The goal of this course is to introduce you to early stages of the project, the concepts of product vs project management, and the application of Agile and other methodologies to the project management processes. My goal is to ensure you get a good introduction to these areas, to complement the Agile/Scrum techniques you have seen and used during the development team and sprint cycles. The most important goal is your learning, and all the readings, exercises, and presentations are designed to help with that goal. As your instructor, I am here to support you during this journey so you can achieve your highest and best potential. 
Office Hours

The time I have listed as “Office hours” is time for you. Office hours are a chance for you to meet with me one-on-one or in small groups to discuss the course, your questions, an assignment, your learning, your plans for the future, or just to check in. Office hours can be in person or via MS Teams. You can schedule an appointment using Microsoft Bookings at Booking Page.

Links to an external site. If we are meeting online, the invite will include a Teams meeting just for our appointment, to ensure you receive my full attention during your time slot – and to maintain your privacy. You may invite other students to join if you wish.
Contact and Response Times

Contact by email is preferred, but MS Teams is also a very good choice. Please use good email etiquette - use a proper greeting, include your first and last name in the signature, and put the course number either in the subject or body of the email. Be sure to include your specific question, including what assignment or problem you are working on. Describe what you have tried so far, and what you want my help with. Note:  do this on Teams as well. Don't just say "Hi Professor" and wait; send your question, code file, diagram, etc., and I will respond when I can. Expect a fairly quick response time for emails and IM's during business hours (usually less than 4 hours) , or the next business day if the email is sent late or over the weekend. If there is a legitimate emergency, mark your message as high priority. I often respond quickly on Teams or email, but I can't guarantee it. Note that anything "official" should be done by email, e.g. arranging to miss a class, asking to extend an assignment deadline, ask a question about grading, etc.

Formatting and Submitting your Assignments

Link to Assignment Submission and Citation Guidelines page

It is important that your work is clearly presented and easy to read, so I will provide Word and PowerPoint templates that you can download from Canvas. This will enable me to return your work more quickly, and give you a framework to start from. Equally, your efforts should be focused on the content, not the layout, so you must present your work as follows.

 

How?
	

Why?

Upload to Canvas
	

… because it’s easier and eco-friendlier than printing it out, and more reliable than emailing. Be sure to upload your assignments as an attachment – and always keep a copy.

Upload as a PDF

(except PPTX files)
	

… because that’s the simplest format for me to be able to access, read, and make comments.

Use 11 point Arial or Calibri (for PC) or 11 point Helvetica (for Mac) font
	

… because sans serif fonts like Arial and Helvetica are easier to read on screen than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman), particularly for people with visual impairment.

Left-align all text
	

… because left-aligned text is easier to read since the spaces between the words are equal. Justified text (where both margins are squared) has uneven spaces that can cause reading problems, especially for people with visual impairment or with dyslexia.

Single-space all text
	

… because we work on digital documents, we don't really need room to write comments between lines.

Use black for all text
	

… because this is easier to read.

Include a Word Count at the end of the assignment
	

… so that your instructor can see how much you have written and so that you can gauge whether you are within 10% of the required word count. (if one is specified)

 
Bibliography/References and citation requirements

Cite all sources you quoted, used, paraphrased, etc. To avoid plagiarism, see the Academic Integrity section.
All your in-text citations and your list of references must follow the APA Publication Manual (7th edition) since it is the standard referencing system for this discipline. It may be different from other systems you have used, so follow the Manual’s citation guidelines carefully. This is an opportunity to demonstrate your attention to detail. To help you, you can use Purdue University’s Online Writing Lab (OWL)

Links to an external site. pages on APA, and if you’re having difficulty, arrange to meet with me and we can go over any trouble-spots together.
Assignment Deadline and Extensions

The assignments in this course build on one another, so the feedback process is an important part of your learning. My plan is therefore to return your assignments as soon as possible after you have submitted them. (My normal policy is to return papers within five working days; I hope to be able to keep to that this quarter, as I have two student graders assisting me.) Faster feedback means you’re more likely to remember what you wrote and can more easily take the feedback on board for the next assignment. It would greatly help the learning process if you are able to submit your assignment by the stated deadlines. If you find that you are unable to complete an assignment on time, please communicate with me in advance via email. I do understand that life happens and can sometimes get in the way. I’ll do my best to be flexible; for that to happen, we need to have a dialogue so that I know where you are in your learning and how I can best support you. To help keep yourself on track, I strongly encourage you to plan ahead: Check the session-by-session schedule at the end of this syllabus to see when assignment briefings will be given and when assignments are due. This enables you to block out time in your calendar now so that you know when you will be working on assignments for this course. If you’re wondering how much time you need to allow for completing assignments well, then I suggest you use the approach I take for my own writing: make a rough estimate of time and then multiply it by 2.5. This sounds like a lot, but I think you’ll find it more realistic for managing your expectations and planning.

It greatly impacts the grading and feedback timing if you submit assignments late, so I will assign a 20% late penalty for each day an assignment is late, with the first late deduction being for anything more than a few minutes after the due date/time, with another 20% being deducted at each 24 hour mark after the due date/time. 
I will give you a one-time pass to be up to 24 hours late, for one assignment. This applies only to HW or Individual Project assignments, not to TW, Quizzes, Exams, or Team Project assignments. Obviously, this also doesn't apply to in-class presentations. To use this, you should contact me before the assignment is late by email, and you should add a note in Canvas that you are using this late pass. 
Team Project

Students will be in preselected  teams of  3 or 4. This is a group project, and there will be a designated team leader who will be responsible for submitting the work on behalf of the team. Every team member will receive the same group grade. This might not seem fair, but it is too difficult to try to assess individually. 

Note that every student will be asked to evaluate and provide feedback on other team's work. And every student will also be asked to provide a candid assessment of how each member of their team contributed multiple times during the quarter. In rare exceptions, grading on the team project for each individual can be significantly impacted based on this peer assessment. My advice is to make sure you are a good team member; contributing to the project, delivering on the commitments you made to your team, and fully engaging to make sure your team project deliverables are excellent work. Raise any issues as early as possible, so there is still time for required changes to take place. If there are some team members that are concerned about a teammate, you can talk to me, and I will decide if I need to intervene.

Expectations for team project:

    Teams are chosen by the students. If you want to change teams, this can be done but only if you find someone to on the other team to swap places with, and both parties agree to the change. This needs to be done very early in the quarter.
    Team members should exchange contact information.
    Teams should plan to meet outside of class sessions.
    You will get some time in class to work on team projects as part of Teamwork, but you will not be able to achieve excellent results (or grade) if that is the only time you work together on the project. 
    If you are having problems with a team member or team dynamics, try to resolve the issue with honest communication as early as possible. If you need help from the instructor, contact me as early as possible. It is very difficult for everyone involved if no problem is reported until after the team project is delivered: that is too late to take any corrective action.
    Every team member will receive the same grade on the team project.

 

Grading Scale

The grade breakdown is shown below. Grades on any assignment, quiz, or exam may be adjusted linearly if I deem it appropriate.

            A     >= 95.0%         Superior
            A-    >= 90.0%
            B+   > =87.0%
            B     >= 84.0%         Good
            B-    >= 80.0%
            C+   >= 77.0%
            C     > =74.0%         Adequate
            C-    >= 70.0%
            D+   >= 67.0%
            D     > 64.0%           Poor
            D-    >= 60.0% 
            F      <   60.0%         Failing

Final Grade: 
Your final grade will be calculated as noted above, however, you must receive at least 70% on the Final Exam to pass this course with a grade of C or better.  
Minimum Grade Requirement for Courses

Note that a grade of C or better is needed in order to satisfy CS major and minor requirements. For required courses, this means you will need to retake a course if you get a C- or lower. And a grade of C or better is required for the course to count as a prerequisite for any future course that requires it.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY 

Plagiarism and cheating are taken very seriously. Learn more about this by reviewing the Academic Integrity Tutorial.
Academic Integrity resources for students (Links to an external site.)
Links to an external site. 
SU Academic Integrity Policy (Links to an external site.)

Links to an external site. 

Plagiarism is the unacknowledged use of the work or intellectual property of other persons, published or unpublished, presented as one's own work. All students are expected to work on all individual assignments independently. Collaboration on individual assignments is considered cheating and will be penalized accordingly. Other examples of behavior that is not tolerated in this class include copying all or part of someone else's work and submitting it as your own, sharing your assignment solution with other students in the class, consulting with another student during an exam, and copying text from published literature without proper attribution. If you have questions about what is allowed, please discuss it with the instructor. All students are responsible for reading and following the Seattle University Academic Integrity Policy. Students who violate University standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary sanctions, including failure in the course and suspension from the University. The minimum penalty is a zero on the submission in question.

A Note About Grades

As I mentioned, grades are mostly about providing feedback. If you don't get a perfect score, that isn't a failure, that is a learning opportunity. I am happy to discuss assignments, the feedback given, and how to apply it to future assignments. I will not regrade an assignment after it has been returned, unless I made an error in the grading process. 

If you believe I made an error in grading your assignment, please contact me by email within a week of when the assignment was returned to you with a grade. Please do not contact the student graders with any grading questions. I will consider the issue, and may make a grade change, or I may not. My decision on grading is final.

 
HOW  CLASS  WILL  WORK
Your workload in this course

For every hour in class, you can expect to devote an average of two hours outside of class for readings and preparation, as well as substantive assignments and participation exercises. As this is a five-credit class, you can reasonably expect an average of 10 hours of homework each week. I have tried to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed throughout the course, but if you find you have less than the normal amount of work one week, I suggest you read ahead for future classes, or work on your individual and team projects.
Instructional methods

Education research shows that your learning is greatest when you are actively involved in making sense of new concepts (“constructing knowledge”) and when you do this in social settings. This model is technically called “social constructivism,” and is closely aligned with the Jesuit teaching tradition (Ignatian pedagogy). We will use this model throughout the course, so you can expect to:

    Be engaged in plenty of classroom activities and discussions
    Present material (that is supplemented by readings) that is unique for that week.
    Work in small groups during class and for those groups to change on a regular basis
    Ask questions, engage in discussions, and your instructor for clarifications, rather than expecting canned lectures.
    Be active with a project that is industry-relevant, and practices the knowledge learned in class.
    There are times when we have discussions to talk about the industry we are part of (software), and ethical discussions might result. Instructor attempts to moderate discussion (not necessarily give a personal opinion), but encourages students to voice their opinions.  Seattle University is much more than just teaching the course basics. It has always been known for student development in issues beyond just the course being taught. 

Classroom expectations

    All students should attempt to be in class before class begins.
    Students should attempt to have all other computer applications put away during class time in order to not be distracted. 
    Students may spend time working in small groups or teams, in class, and outside of class.
    Students may be asked to present individual or team project results in class.

Attendance and Participation Expectations:

Numerous research studies have shown that when students actively ask and answer questions, they take greater interest in the material, they clarify shared misconceptions, and they retain more information. Studies also show that missing classes – and therefore missing the opportunity to process ideas together with your peers – negatively affects your grades, even without an attendance grade. (Get in touch if you’d like to find out more about this.) 

I would like to see all of you find ways to participate actively in class (in small- and large-group settings), as well as in any activities or discussions on Canvas. I will not take formal daily attendance, but I’ll get in touch with you if I notice you are regularly absent or if you appear to be inattentive in class, just to be sure you are ok and to find out what would best help you learn.

If you are sick, please stay home and rest so that you can recover more quickly and can be fully present in class when you are better. (See notes below on what to do if you miss a class.)

Class attendance is strongly encouraged. Students missing a class are responsible for any material assigned or covered in class during their absence.  Students are encouraged to actively participate in class discussions.  Makeup lectures will not be given during office hours or at any other times.
Presentations, teamwork and quizzes will be frequent, and note that in-class work cannot be made up, and missing them will result in a zero grade.

I am not able to support Zoom-and-live-classroom hybrid model. Attendance by Zoom will not be offered, unless the whole class is attending remotely by Zoom. If you need an accommodation validated by Disability Services, please discuss this with me.
ZOOM Class recording

If the class meets on Zoom or uses Zoom for presentations in class, meetings of this course may be recorded. Any recordings will only be available to students registered for this class. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.
If You Miss a Class

If you expect to be absent or to be late to a class, please e-mail me beforehand (or as soon as possible). I will pass on your apologies to the group at the start of class.

If you do miss a class, you need to obtain notes from one of your peers to catch up. (You might want to pair up with a classmate at the start of the quarter/semester so that you know who to turn to first.) If, after going over those notes and checking the readings for the class, you still have questions, please arrange to meet me during office hours to discuss. Remember to have those notes and your targeted questions ready so that we can use the time to focus on your learning.

Note that if you have pre-arranged an excused absence with me, then I will work with you on how to get you caught up.

 

 
Academic Resources to Support Your Learning

My goal is to create a learning environment in which you can be highly successful and feel supported. I will work hard to create and improve the learning environment throughout the quarter based on my own observations of the course and your feedback on what would help you learn more. In return, I ask and encourage you to make the most of this learning opportunity.

You may find that some of your previously successful learning strategies aren't working as well. Developing new strategies will help your learning greatly.

I encourage you to explore the services below and to work on the assumption that you’ll always be developing some new strategies that will help you become a more flexible learner. I am delighted to support you in that growth, and plan to build in opportunities for us all to share new strategies with one another either in scheduled class time or by communicating and meeting outside of class.

Support for students with disabilities

Seattle University values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that each student is afforded an equal opportunity to participate in learning experiences. Disability Services (DS) works with students with disabilities to provide reasonable accommodations to support their learning experiences. Disabilities include “invisible disabilities,” such as a learning disability, a chronic health problem, or a mental health condition. This could include any long-term effects of COVID, even after recovery (“long-COVID”), if a health care provider determines it is a chronic health problem.

If you have, or suspect you may have, a disability that may interfere with your performance as a student in this course and have not yet been assessed by DS, please contact DS staff at DS@seattleu.edu or (206) 296-5740. Disability-based accommodations to course expectations can be made only through this process and must be approved by DS before implemented in a course. I am committed to working with you, so please consider meeting with me to discuss the logistics of implementing any accommodations approved by DS.
Notice on Religious Accommodations

It is the policy of Seattle University to reasonably accommodate students who, due to the observance of religious holidays, expect to be absent or endure a significant hardship during certain days of their academic course or program. Please see, Policy on Religious Accommodations for Students (https://www.seattleu.edu/media/policies/Policy-on-Religious-Accommodations-for-Students---FINAL.PDF
